        Question.2. Difference Between Gobal Scope and Block Scope? 
                
        <div>
            <p><strong> Global Scope:</strong>If variable is declared outside all functions or curly braces, it is said to be defined in the global scope. Once you've declared a global variable, you can use that variable any where in your code even in function.</p>
            <p><strong> Block Scope:</strong>When you declare a variable with const or let within a curly brace, you can access this variable only within that curly brace.</p>
        </div>
